# Welcome to my Portfolio Assignment for Week 2!

Link to Project Page: <a href= "https://plutocoders.github.io/assignment2Portfolio/"> Pages Link Here </a>

The repo is setup so that assets such as css styling and images are inside the Assets folder.
Inside the Assets folder is the css folder, which contains the reset.css and style.css, as well as the Images Folder.

Outside of that, index.html contains the bones of the project.

The purpose of this project is to display projects in an easy to view portfolio, as well as contact information for potential employers to contact me.

# Summary
- In this project, my portfolio, we have many elements such as a header with a title and navigation elements to the right
- The header is fixed, so it will stay in place even if the user scrolls up and down.
- There is a background image under the header
- Under the background image we have portfolio elements that will one day contain links to different projects.
- Under the portfolio elements, there is the about me section, which gives potential employers some information about me.
- The footer, at the very bottom, contains some contact information for others to contact me.

# Other Notes
- The reset CSS contains copied code from week 2 notes during the reset section.
- I used unsplash.com for free images.
- Other than reviewing some class notes from week 2, I also used this video as reference: https://youtu.be/wRNinF7YQqQ
- My brother Furkan also tried to help me a bit.
